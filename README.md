Algerian Forest Fire Prediction using ElasticNetCV

This machine learning model predicts the likelihood or intensity of forest fires in Algeria based on meteorological and environmental features. It uses the ElasticNetCV algorithm, a regularized linear regression technique that combines L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) penalties. ElasticNetCV automatically selects the best regularization parameters using cross-validation, helping prevent overfitting and handle correlated features. The model is trained on historical data including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall, making it effective for early forest fire warning systems.
